LOG FOR TEAM FROGS:
This file contains a record of all additions and suggestions by members of team FROGS

2021-12-16 8:42 pm EST
Samantha, Ivina, and Ruby start creating a plan to implement tests for how long BinSearch  and LinSearch respectfully take.
Samantha suggests measuring the time at the begining of the method and at the ending of the method (INSIDE the method)
This will measure how long the loops take.
Ruby suggests putting a start and end time in the main method before the test call to BinSearch and Linsearch and after.
This will measure how long the methods take.
Ivina agrees with Samantha that it would be more reasonable to put the time stamps inside the method itself.

2021-12-16 8:51 pm EST
To determine how long the methods take, Samantha, Ruby and Ivina decide to measure the currentTimeMillis before the
method, then after the method, and measure the difference to get the time in miliseconds that BinSearch and LinSearch
take to use.

2021-12-16 8:54 pm EST
Ivina brings up that we will need to import java.util.Date to measure the time, Ruby and Samantha are captivated by Ivina's intelligence.

2021-12-16 9:03 pm EST
Ivina and Samantha change their minds. After Ruby's persuasive convincing, Samantha and Ivina now believe that the time stamps
should be measured in the main method. This is to avoid editing an already working java file and put it in the driver (which
hasn't been written yet instead)

2021-12-17 12:38 - 1:19 pm EST
Ivina, Ruby, and Samantha created issues on other teams plans and then proceeded to update their own plans to prepare for programming.

2021-12-19 8:20 pm EST
Samantha discovered the proper syntaxing for finding the currentTimeMillis() to measure how long binSearch and linSearch take in milliseconds,
Ruby implemented the first test case on an 1000 length array, the team was shocked when both methods seemed to only take 0 milliseconds.
Ivina suggested going to much longer lengths such as a million and even 1 billion. Ruby declined to go above 100 million for fear that their
computer would crash.
The team collectively decided to use for loops to construct their arrays, create a random target each time, and repeat testing on the same array many times.

2021-12-20 12:38 - 1:19 pm EST
Samantha suggested using a nested for loop to simplify code and prevent re-writing code that had essentially already been written.
Ruby disagreed, saying that nested for loops could become confusing easily, and suggested writing helper methods instead.
Ivina pitched in and agreed with Ruby, the trio spent the rest of the class period implementing methods to simplify code and prevent re-writing repetitive
code in the main method. By the end of class there was a new method in the driver file for finding the average time linSearch and binSearch took to run
on different sized arrays with 100 trials for each size.

2021-12-20 8:36 pm EST
Ivina found the piazza post that said we should be using target at the worst case scenario for binSearch and linSearch. Prior to this team FROGS had used 
a randomized target.

2021-12-20 8:42 pm EST
The three FROG members created a method in the driver file called populate, which populated an array with increments of 1.
After editing the methods to account for the worst case scenario, which Samantha decided was when the value wasn't in the array, (though Ruby wasn't sure
if the last digit for linSearch could also be a worst case scenario, and the group debated this for quite a bit before coming to the conclusion that
Samantha's way was perfectly acceptable) the team declared their driver file to be completed!

2021-12-20 9:28 pm EST
Still grinning from finishing their driver file, team FROGS members began to update their notes, log, and README files to reflect their new discoveries!

2021-12-21 12:38 - 1:19 pm EST
The trio was shocked to find out that this lab would continue yet another day! Samantha and Ivina seperated off from Ruby to view others code, meanwhile,
Ruby presented to various other teams.
Through this comparing of algorithims and code, the team reconvened with new knowledge ready to implement changes to their existing driver file.

2021-12-21 8:14 pm EST
Ruby changed the worst case scenerio for binSearch and linSearch to the last element in the array.
Ivina suggested implementing more trials for each array, and the FROGS updated the driver file to now have 200 trials for each array length.
Samantha suggested that instead of taking an average of the values, and getting strange decimals we should print out the sum of the 200 trials and
say this was the total. Thus our driver file now prints out this sum of milliseconds for 200 trials rather then giving a confusing and long decimal with
e and 20 decimal places.

2021-12-21 8:39 pm EST
Samantha and Ivina discussed what they learned from viewing other teams work, updated Ruby on the "tea" and began to implement what they thought the other
teams had done well, (in addition they added a new section to notes detailing what they had learned from this expierence).
Ruby updated the README file to accomadate the new data.
Samantha brought up the piazza post by team walrus that explained a previous bug/typo in the origional library BinSearch.java, the FROGS then re-updated
their BinSearch.java file.

2021-12-21 9:18 pm EST
Alas! After updating all neccesary files, team FROGS declared that they had completed the lab, or had they...
