L03 -- Get Empirical 
2021-12-16
time spent: 3.0 hrs

DISCO:
 * We don't need to import java.util.System because it is already embedded into Java files.
 * binSearch is EXTREMELY fast compared to linSearch. At 100,000,000 length arrays binSearch
   still takes 0 miliseconds, whereas linSearch often takes above 100 miliseconds.
 * When writing out big numbers, putting in an underscore in between numbers acts as a comma
   and java ignores the underscores.

QCC:
 * How big can we make the Comparable arrays until we put our computer at risk for crashing?
 * Is there a faster method of searching then BinSearch?
 * Is there a way for us to see nanoseconds, or a smaller increment of time then miliseconds?

NOTES:
 * In order to measure the time LinSearch and BinSearch take to run, we 
   will measure before they run, and after they run and find the difference
   to determine how long they took to run.
 * We should find the time stamps in the driver file main method to avoid 
   editing the methods of 2 already working java files (BinSearch and LinSearch)
