we are going to have instance variables _beginTime and _endTime. both will be in ms. we will utilize the currentTimeMillis() method from the embedded System library

we are going to copy over code from the library for both our Binary and Linear Search methods

we decided to measure time in the Driver file.

we will change the sizes of the array by a mulititude of 10 each time

we will use a for/while loop in our driver file to repeat our experiment multiple times. we will then average out the time elapsed per trial to get more accurate results. (specifically, we will do it 20 times per array). we will need for loops to create AND populate arrays in our Driver file.

for our arrays, we are thinking of having lengths of 1,10,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000,10000000,100000000.

we will change whether or not the item is in the array to create varying test cases.

---

an array with the length 1,000,000 took only a max of 4ms (for LinSearch, 0ms for BinSearch) -> so we're trying out an arrays 100,000,000+ elements
