Samantha, Ivina, and Ruby start creating a plan to implement tests for how long BinSearch  and LinSearch respectfully take.
Samantha suggests measuring the time at the begining of the method and at the ending of the method (INSIDE the method)
This will measure how long the loops take.
Ruby suggests putting a start and end time in the main method before the test call to BinSearch and Linsearch and after. 
This will measure how long the methods take.
Ivina agrees with Samantha that it would be more reasonable to put the time stamps inside the method itself.

To determine how long the methods take, Samantha, Ruby and Ivina decide to measure the currentTimeMillis before the
method, then after the method, and measure the difference to get the time in miliseconds that BinSearch and LinSearch
take to use.

Ivina brings up that we will need to import java.util.Date to measure the time, Ruby and Samantha are captivated by Ivina's intelligence.

Ivina and Samantha change their minds. After Ruby's persuasive convincing, Samantha and Ivina now believe that the time stamps
should be measured in the main method. This is to avoid editing an already working java file and put it in the driver (which
hasn't been written yet instead)

Ivina, Ruby, and Samantha created issues on other teams plans and then proceeded to update their own plans to prepare for programming.

2021-12-19 8:20 pm EST
Samantha discovered the proper syntaxing for finding the currentTimeMillis() to measure how long binSearch and linSearch take in milliseconds,
Ruby implemented the first test case on an 1000 length array, the team was shocked when both methods seemed to only take 0 milliseconds.
Ivina suggested going to much longer lengths such as a million and even 1 billion. Ruby declined to go above 100 million for fear that their
computer would crash. 
The team collectively decided to use for loops to construct their arrays, create a random target each time, and repeat testing on the same array many times.
