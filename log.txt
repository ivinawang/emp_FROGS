Samantha, Ivina, and Ruby start creating a plan to implement tests for how long BinSearch  and LinSearch respectfully take.
Samantha suggests measuring the time at the begining of the method and at the ending of the method (INSIDE the method)
This will measure how long the loops take.
Ruby suggests putting a start and end time in the main method before the test call to BinSearch and Linsearch and after. 
This will measure how long the methods take.
Ivina agrees with Samantha that it would be more reasonable to put the time stamps inside the method itself.

To determine how long the methods take, Samantha, Ruby and Ivina decide to measure the currentTimeMillis before the
method, then after the method, and measure the difference to get the time in miliseconds that BinSearch and LinSearch
take to use.

Ivina brings up that we will need to import java.util.Date to measure the time, Ruby and Samantha are captivated by Ivina's intelligence.
