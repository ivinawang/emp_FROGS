NOTES:
 * In order to measure the time LinSearch and BinSearch take to run, we 
   will measure before they run, and after they run and find the difference
   to determine how long they took to run.
 * We should find the time stamps in the driver file main method to avoid 
   editing the methods of 2 already working java files (BinSearch and LinSearch)
